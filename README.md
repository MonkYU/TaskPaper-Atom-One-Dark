# Atom One Dark for TaskPaper 3

A dark theme for [TaskPaper 3](http://taskpaper.com) heavily inspired on (stolen from) [Atom One Dark Syntax](https://github.com/atom/one-dark-syntax).


## Features

- Green for items tagged @today or @active
- Cyan for items tagged @next
- Red for items tagged @flag  or @high or @prio
- Faded blue for items tagged @waiting
- Selection is a subtle tint color which allows for easy reading of all text

## Other features

- Done tasks are dimmed so as not to distract from what needs to be done
- Done tasks also mutes all other colours that may have been applied from previous tags
- Notes are also dimmed in relation to tasks.
- Tags are always dimmed in relation to task text.
- Saved searches are a more subdued tone as not to distract from main list
